Definitions (used for this project):

* Naked Pair: Two cells in a group contain an identical pair of candidates and only those two candidates.
* Hidden Pair: Two cells in a group contain a pair of candidates (hidden amongst other candidates) that are not found in any other cells in that group.
* Naked Triple: Three cells in a group contain no candidates other than the same three candidates. The cells DON'T have to contain every candidate of the triple.
* Hidden Triple: Three candidates are restricted to three cells in a given group. All other candidates in those three cells can be excluded.
